# Todo-List

Open two terminals and run the two scripts below respectively.

Please yarn first under Todo-List directory.

The database I use is postgresql, and I write a dockerfile under the Todo-List directory.

To start backend, simply run script yarn server at Todo-List directory, please create the .env according .env.defaults first.

To start frontend, simply run script yarn start at Todo-List directory.

They will hopefully yarn (install packages) for you.
